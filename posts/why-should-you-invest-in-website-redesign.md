<!-- # The Ultimate Guide to Markdown -->
Nowadays every company has a website. People have their own web presence. Most of the digital campaigns lead you to the website. Gaining more traction and converting potential audiences is the ultimate purpose behind all of it. 

Your website is the face of your brand. It's their interaction and user experience that decide if they are sticking to you or not. That is why, now more than ever, it is critical to keep your website fresh and distinct—and to ensure that you are making the correct impression. Here comes a website redesign!

## Why you should redesign your website?

Instead of listing them down and explaining each, let me make it easy for you by summarising the reasons into high-level categories.

Find them as follows:

1.  Technically strong
2.  Brand identity
3.  Content and strategy
4.  Boosting/ acceleration

Take a minute to broaden your vision with these 4 aspects and look at the title.

Now, let’s give the instant inputs that explain the **benefits of redesigning the website.**

1.  **Make the website technically strong:**\
    This is the major reason to redesign your website.  
    The world is rapidly evolving digitally and technologies have become more advanced by the day. This is the best time when you can identify the **opportunity to improve** or even **restart** the **journey**. You can update on existing website functionality or add new. Upgrading with **modern technologies** helps to recover all the technical aspects such as responsive screens all over the platforms, popular and **efficient CMS** and cutting-edge technology that is effective in the long run.

2.  **Refresh the brand identity**\
    In case you want to change the whole branding look and feel, it’s the correct time for you to go for a website redesign. This includes changing the **color combinations, theme, font style and images**.
    
    We can't deny the fact that user experience is the game changer and it’s the important benefit of rebranding the website. Give a thought to makeover your website that helps you stand unique and popular with your end users. While redesigning your website, you should know basic things like as [UI UX design principles](/ui-ux-design-principles)
    
    A good website design will include, among other things, the creation of exceptional content, a stunning aesthetic, and efficient call-to-action buttons. Each of these will result in a higher conversion rate and increased sales.
    
3.  **Raise the standard of brand voice**\
    _“Content is the King”_. To convey the right message to an audience, it is very important to give fresh and user-centric content that makes an impact. It’s not possible to keep the same content for more than 5-6 years. Consider your digital presence completely, and update your content strategy alongside your website to build a coherent, cohesive, and modern digital powerhouse.
    

1.  **Accelerate and stay ahead of competitors**\
    Building your website is not enough to rank gain traction or attract potential users. For that, a little extra effort on acceleration is a cherry on the cake.
    
    The acceleration includes -
    
    *   **Site performance -**\
        A website that takes more than 3 seconds is more likely not to get the expected traffic. The websites steal the attention with high performance.
        
    *   **Improved SEO -**\
        Does your existing website appear above on search engines? Let me tell you one thing, search engines must rank you before you become well-liked by potential users. Redesigns of websites are a great opportunity to update your brand identity and include important keywords to improve site performance. Make sure the material on your website is in line with both what users are looking for and what they can discover there.
        
    *   **Added security -**\
        Brands must take steps to safeguard the security of their own and their customers' personal data because cyber threats and hidden risks can be found anywhere on the digital web. That is why, when it comes to website redesigns, this is a vital benefit to end on, from both a user and a brand aspect.
        
2.  **Checklist for website redesign: When it’s time to redesign my website?**\
    Ask yourself and your team the following questions and then think about website redesign.
    *   Have your target audience and value propositions changed?
    *   Is the technology on your website outdated?
    *   Does your company correctly represent your brand?
    *   Does it take too long for your website to load?
    *   Is the mobile website experience lacking?
    *   Are conversion rates dropping?
    *   Do users have a fun time using your website?
    *   Is the SEO for your website up to par?
    *   Does your website make running your business simpler?
    *   Is it simple to navigate your website?
